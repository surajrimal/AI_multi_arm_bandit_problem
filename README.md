# AI_multi_arm_bandit_problem
Implement a 5 armed bandit problem with greedy and ɛ-greedy action selection algorithms.
Compare the results of ɛ -greedy action selection method (ɛ =0.4) with the greedy one. 
Which one works better over 100 time-steps in 200 runs?
You can choose any distribution/values for your reward function and/or other parameters.
